TODO list:
* Remove hardcoded CSS settings from source code
  * To be configurable in config file.
  * To prevent the label size too large for each grid
    * which causes grids excedding the screen. 
* Highlight the first letter when pressed.
* The outer lines should be the same pixelated with the inner lines for grids
