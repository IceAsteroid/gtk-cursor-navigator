TODO list:
* Remove hardcoded CSS settings from source code
  * To be configurable in config file.
  * To prevent the label size too large for each grid
    * which causes grids excedding the screen.
* Highlight the first letter when pressed.
* The outer lines should be the same pixelated with the inner lines for grids
* Add the ability to configure core ergonomic keys to select the two letters of each grid in config file instead of hardcoded.
* The ergonomic keys should be first letter on left hand, and second letter on right hand.
  * After all combinations are exhausted, reverse all combinations by first letter on right hand, and seond on right.
  * After all of above are exhausted, generate the rest combinations for grids with same handed keys.
