TODO list:
* Remove hardcoded CSS settings from source code
  * To be configurable in config file.
  * To prevent the label size too large for each grid
    * which causes grids excedding the screen.
* Highlight the first letter when pressed.
* The outer lines should be the same pixelated with the inner lines for grids
* Add the ability to configure core ergonomic keys in config file instead of hardcoded.
